# Scoliosis Detection: Edge-Preserving Preprocessing of Spinal X-Rays Using PDEs and Deep Learning-Based Classification

## Abstract

ARC is a cutting-edge project focused on improving scoliosis diagnosis through advanced image processing and machine learning techniques. By leveraging Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) for image pre-processing and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classification, this project enhances the accuracy of spinal X-ray analysis. Additionally, U-Net is utilized for precise line segmentation to assist in Cobb angle measurement, a critical metric for assessing scoliosis severity.

## Features

- **Noise Reduction:** Pre-processes spinal X-rays using the Heat Equation and Anisotropic Diffusion for improved image clarity and edge preservation.
- **Automated Classification:** Employs a CNN to classify spinal images as either normal or indicative of scoliosis.
- **Segmentation:** Utilizes U-Net to segment spinal structures and identify key anatomical landmarks.
- **Cobb Angle Calculation:** Automates the measurement of Cobb angles using image analysis, facilitating accurate scoliosis diagnosis.

## Methodology

1. **Pre-Processing:**

   - **Diffusion Equation:** Smooths images to reduce noise while balancing edge detail.
   - **Anisotropic Diffusion:** Enhances edge preservation while minimizing noise in X-ray images.

2. **Classification:**

   - A CNN is trained on labeled X-ray images to identify scoliosis patterns with high accuracy.

3. **Segmentation:**

   - U-Net is applied to extract spinal cord structures from X-ray images, ensuring precise segmentation for angle measurement.

4. **Cobb Angle Calculation:**
   - Integrates Python-based algorithms for consistent and precise Cobb angle determination.
